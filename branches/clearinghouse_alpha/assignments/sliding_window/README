Sliding Window Protocol

--==[ About ]==--
This code is an implementation of Sliding Window assignment
found at:
 https://seattle.cs.washington.edu/wiki/SlidingWindowAssignment
All instructions below should, hopefully, work on any Linux 
machine.

--==[ Dependencies ]==--
You must have Repy, Repypp, and Seash.
For example, to download them for Linux type:
 $ wget https://seattlegeni.cs.washington.edu/geni/download/flibble/seattle_linux.tgz
 $ tar xgf seattle_linux.tgz
You should then see a folder named "seattle_repy."

--==[ Manifest ]==--
The Makefile expects the following layout:
 extra_reliable/Makefile
 extra_reliable/README
 extra_reliable/extra_reliable_client.repy
 extra_reliable/extra_reliable_server.repy
 extra_reliable/extra_reliable.repy
 extra_reliable/test/restrictions.default
 extra_reliable/test/in.file
 extra_reliable/seattle_repy
Where seattle_repy is your Seattle download.

--==[ Running the code locally ]==--
To run the local example, type:
 $ make test
Check test/junk_test.out.  Correct output is:
 $ cat test/junk_test.out
 hello world!!  Foo bar baz.  Goodbye!

--==[ Getting remotely setup ]==--
For instructions on getting Clearinghouse setup go to:
  https://seattle.cs.washington.edu/wiki/SeattleShell
  https://seattle.cs.washington.edu/wiki/TakeHomeAssignment
  https://seattle.cs.washington.edu/wiki/RepyTutorial
Write down your Clearinghouse port.  You'll see it on the "User Info" tab.
Grab at least two nodes from the "Used Resources" tab.  
Put your Clearinghouse keys into the extra_reliable/test/ directory.

--==[ Running the code remotely ]==--
Make sure the code is linked:
 $ make
You should have test/extra_reliable_client and test/extra_reliable_server.
To run remotely, cd into test and start seash:
 $ cd test && python ../seattle_linux/seash.py
Load your keys and bring up vessels:
 !> loadkeys roger
 !> as roger
 roger@ !> browse
 roger@ !> on browsegood
Upload the file:
 roger@browsegood !> on %1 upload in.file
Then, run the client on one node and the server on another:
 roger@browsegood !> on %2 run extra_reliable_server junk_test.out <Clearinghouseport>
 roger@browsegood !> on %1 run extra_reliable_client in.file <IP of %2> <Clearinghouseport> <IP of %1>
Replace the <IP of %x> with the IP of the remote vessel.  You can see
these by doing:
 roger@browsegood !> list
Replace <Clearinghouseport> with your unique port from the Clearinghouse website.

--==[ Examining remote output ]==--
Check the logs:
 roger@browsegood !> show log
Example log:
"""
  roger@browsegood !> show log
  Log from '128.112.139.75:1224:v4':

  Client: Finished sending

  Server: Shutting down
"""
Download the file:
 roger@browsegood !> on %2 download junk_test.out
 $ cat junk_test.out
Example output:
 hello world!!  Foo bar baz.  Goodbye!

--==[ Notes ]==--
Here are a few non-obvious details about the protocol:
(1) Bytes always increase from DEFAULT_START_BYTE to infinity.
(2) An ACK with byte X tells the sender that the receiver has
gotten all bytes < X.  Ex. (8, 'ack...') acks 0 <= bytes < 8.
The sender should stop sending all bytes below 8, *even if* the
sender has not received their ACKs.
(3) The window size is hard coded to three times the maxdgramsize.
Change WINDOW_SIZE_MULTIPLIER if desired.
