<Purpose>
  The purpose of the NAT Punch Affix is to allow a machine that is behind
  a NAT to be accessed. The way it works is that the machine that is
  behind a NAT (or some sort of firewall) will make a connection to a
  Nat Forwarder machine and wait for incoming traffic. A Nat Forwarder
  machine is a special machine that is not behind NAT and can be accessed
  by both the server and the client.
