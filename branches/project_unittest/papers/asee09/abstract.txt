Cloud computing is rapidly increasing in popularity. Companies such as
RedHat, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and IBM are increasingly funding
cloud computing infrastructure and research, making it important for
students to learn how to work with cloud-based
resources. This presentation describes a free, educational research platform
called Seattle that is community-driven, a common denominator for
diverse platform types, and is broadly deployed.

Seattle is also surprisingly flexible and supports a variety of
pedagogical uses because it represents a common denominator 
for cloud computing, grid computing, peer-to-peer networking,
distributed systems, and networking. Seattle programs are written in a 
subset of the Python language which is easy to learn and simple 
(<10 LOC for UDP ping, detour routing, or source routing).
Seattle programs are portable across different 
operating systems and architectures without change.   

Seattle is community-driven --- universities donate available
resources on multi-user machines to the platform. These donations 
come from a wide variety of operating systems and
architectures, removing the need for a dedicated infrastructure.
Our current deployment of Seattle consists of about one thousand computers
that are distributed around the world.   

Our presentation includes a live demonstration and an open invitation to the 
community to employ Seattle in their courses.
