In this talk we will present and demo Seattle, a platform for
networking and distributed systems research. Seattle is free,
community-driven, and offers a large deployment of computers spread
across the world. Seattle works by operating on resources donated by
users and institutions. It is currently targeted at educators teaching
networking and distributed systems classes at Universities. However,
the global distribution of the Seattle network provides the ability to
use it in application contexts that include cloud computing,
Peer-to-peer networking, ubiquitous/mobile computing, and distributed
systems.

In this talk we will speak to the need for a new educational internet
testbed -- our project's motivation. Then we will discuss Seattle's
architecture for managing globally deployed resources. Lastly, we will
cover a few powerful uses of Seattle in the classroom and beyond --
from understanding non-transitivity in the Internet, to organizing
massive P2P systems with ease. The last part of our presentation will
feature live demos with user participation.
