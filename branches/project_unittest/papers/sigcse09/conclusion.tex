\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
\label{sec-conclusion}
This work presents the educational networking platform Seattle. Seattle is a
free, portable, and lightweight platform using donated computational
resources. Seattle enables students to learn the concepts of networking and
distributed systems on computers spread around the Internet.   Seattle
can also emulate cloud computing, peer-to-peer computing, and cluster 
computing within a simple framework.   Computers running Seattle are protected 
from malicious and misbehaving code, making it safe to contribute
resources from multi-use computers.
Seattle has resources available for students to use on about a thousand 
computers worldwide.

We are currently working to extend Seattle to improve Seattle's NAT 
traversal and to provide better aggregate restrictions on Seattle traffic.
